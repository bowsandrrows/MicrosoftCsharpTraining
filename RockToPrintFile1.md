### 🌍 Story in Stone  
Forged in a fiery eruption millions of years ago, *Alsterfire* is believed to be a fragment of basaltic scoria—ejected as molten lava and cooled mid-air. Over millennia, it may have crossed continents by ice and stream before settling quietly near Lake Alster. A relic of ancient eruptions history.
Notes:
A smoothed, vesicular volcanic fragment—likely ejected during a basaltic eruption and shaped over time by ancient ice and river activity. Heavy, glass-scratching, and flecked with pale yellow crystal inclusions. A fiery remnant of Earth’s dynamic past, carried from distant eruptions into the calm, forested soils of Sweden.

### 🌍 Story in Stone  
Forged in a fiery eruption millions of years ago, *Alsterfire* is believed to be a fragment of basaltic scoria—ejected as molten lava and cooled mid-air. Over millennia, it may have crossed continents by ice and stream before settling quietly near Lake Alster. A relic of ancient eruptions history.
Notes:
A smoothed, vesicular volcanic fragment—likely ejected during a basaltic eruption and shaped over time by ancient ice and river activity. Heavy, glass-scratching, and flecked with pale yellow crystal inclusions. A fiery remnant of Earth’s dynamic past, carried from distant eruptions into the calm, forested soils of Swede

🌋 Name:           Alsterfire
🪨 Type:           Scoria (Volcanic Rock)
📍 Found At:       Forest edge near Lake Alster, Karlstad, Sweden
📅 Date Discovered:  [Insert your date here]
🔎 Found By:       Seeu

📐 Description:
Porous and vesicular volcanic fragment with melted surface texture,
embedded with tiny translucent quartz- or feldspar-like crystals.
Heavy, non-magnetic, scratches glass — a classic basaltic scoria signature.

🌍 Theorized Origin:
Formed during a basaltic eruption millions of years ago, likely in a
distant volcanic field (e.g., Iceland or Scotland), then carried to
Sweden by glacial forces during the last Ice Age.

🧭 Extra Notes:
A rare blend of fire and frost, this traveler of deep time whispers
of violent eruptions and silent glacial drift — from volcano to forest.

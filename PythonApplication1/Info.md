To use a virtual environment to install and manage packages and libraries like PyGame when running Python code in Visual Studio. 
Here's how you can create and use a virtual environment in Visual Studio:

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Open the Solution Explorer and navigate to your Python project.
3. Right-click on your project name and select **Add** > **Virtual Environment**.
4. In the Add Virtual Environment dialog, you can specify the Python interpreter you want to use and name your virtual environment. Click **Create**.

To activate your virtual environment and install packages like PyGame:

1. Open the **Python Environments** window by going to **View** > **Other Windows** > **Python Environments**.
2. Find your virtual environment in the list and select it.
3. Click on the **Overview** tab, then click on the **Open in PowerShell** or **Open in Command Prompt** button.
4. In the command prompt or PowerShell window, you can now install packages using pip. For example, to install PyGame, type:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

This will install PyGame in your virtual environment, and you can start using it in your Python code in Visual Studio.
